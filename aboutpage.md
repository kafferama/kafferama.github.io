## Kafferama

The name Kafferama comes from joining the german word for coffee **Kaffee** with the suffix **-rama**. The word **Kaffee**<sup>1</sup> was chosen because of the
close relationship there exists between coffee and programming (see e.g. [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/), [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) and [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/about/history.html)). The suffix **-rama** was chosen because of its greek meaning "sight".  The whole word is intended to mean "a look into programming", especially the things that I like to program. 

Coffee was also chosen because it is one of the most iconic products of my origin country Colombia.

<sup>1</sup>
In the name Kafferama, the second e was dropped from **Kaffee**, in order to make its intended pronunciation [ˈkafeɹɑːmə] easier to English speakers.

## Objective

The main objective of this blog is to share to the world the findings that I do after looking how to do something in plenty of StackOverflow questions and a couple of blogs in
a more compact way, or at least the way I would have wanted to find it when I was looking for it. The second objective is to develop some personal projects and showcase the results here, in an effort to improve my expressive skills.

The main topics that this blog will try to cover are:

- Machine Learning
- Computer Vision
- CFD

All in Python.
