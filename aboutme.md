## Juan Felipe Rodriguez

My name is Juan Felipe Rodriguez. I am a mechanical engineer graduated from EAFIT University in Medellin, Colombia. I am currently doing my master at the same University in the field of Visual-SLAM. My main topics of interest are: computational mechanics, CFD, artificial intelligence methods applied to engineering problems and computational methods in general.

I created this blog with the purpose of sharing things I've looked for online and haven't found in a simple manner besides of some personal projects.
If you want to contact me feel free to do so at jfrvk1@gmail.com, feedback is greatly appreciated.
